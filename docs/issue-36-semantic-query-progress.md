# Issue #36 — Semantic Query Progress

Base: `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b`
Branch: `issue-36-semantic-query`
Issue: #36

## Architectural invariant

> State changes do work; reads consume maintained state.

> javac is the semantic authority when Java typing is genuinely required. It is not the ordinary semantic query database.

## Fundamental validity rule

> An event or broad root mismatch is not itself an invalidation. A reusable semantic conclusion becomes invalid only when a semantic proof identity on which it depends can no longer be proven equal.

The migration keeps conservative file/workspace invalidation wherever a precise proof does not yet exist.

## Baseline setup

Starting subject SHA: `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b`

The reviewed revision in the task was `5eb867705eb8edcd357c5ab55bcbfc7340fd6e2d`; current `main` had advanced to `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b` before this branch was created, so the latter is the exact baseline subject.

No production implementation has started. The proof harness is intentionally separate from the measured subject checkout so the same frozen harness can run against both baseline and final revisions with only the subject SHA changing.

## Baseline attempt 1 — JFR reader collision

Run: https://github.com/maxjay/jvmd/actions/runs/36063961275

Subject SHA: `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b`

Changes:
- Added and executed the dedicated Issue #36 proof workflow against the exact subject.
- Built the exact subject and prepared `apache/maven@5cd1b60264101080c712accd605180a4bd9222e0`.
- Reproduced CMP-01 through the production LSP path.

Correctness proof:
- CMP-01 returned zero candidates for the incomplete MavenProject receiver.
- First-use, warmup, steady, resolve and post-unsaved-edit correctness were all false as expected for the baseline bug.

Performance proof:
- First completion: 976.52 ms.
- Steady completion: p50 296.50 ms, p95 347.67 ms across 20 samples.
- Pre-document RSS: 1034.5 MB.
- After first use: 1085.5 MB.
- Steady peak: 1109.3 MB.

Findings:
- The semantic failure is reproduced on the exact starting subject and is not a fixture expectation mismatch.
- The LSP admission boundary was verified by exact-version `publishDiagnostics` before the measured completion.

Failed/deprecated approaches:
- The workflow exported `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-XX:StartFlightRecording=...` for the CMP-01 launcher and then invoked the JDK `jfr` CLI in the same shell. The CLI inherited those options and reopened/truncated the recording it was meant to inspect. `jfr summary` therefore reported an empty recording and aborted the job.
- This is proof-harness failure, not product behavior. The run remains linked here rather than being erased.

Deviations:
- The semantic matrix did not run because the failed JFR inspection occurred before test injection.

Remaining:
- Unset `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` before invoking the JFR CLI.
- Rerun the exact same subject and complete the semantic/query/mutation/classpath matrix before any production implementation.
