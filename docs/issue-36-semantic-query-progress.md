# Issue #36 — Semantic Query Progress

Base: `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b`
Branch: `issue-36-semantic-query`
Issue: #36

## Architectural invariant

> State changes do work; reads consume maintained state.

> javac is the semantic authority when Java typing is genuinely required. It is not the ordinary semantic query database.

## Fundamental validity rule

> An event or broad root mismatch is not itself an invalidation. A reusable semantic conclusion becomes invalid only when a semantic proof identity on which it depends can no longer be proven equal.

The migration keeps conservative file/workspace invalidation wherever a precise proof does not yet exist.

## Baseline setup

Starting subject SHA: `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b`

The reviewed revision in the task was `5eb867705eb8edcd357c5ab55bcbfc7340fd6e2d`; current `main` had advanced to `eb45487f08a986d3a5ef2acd3666177e332cdc9b` before this branch was created, so the latter is the exact baseline subject.

No production implementation has started. The next step is to add and freeze the PR-local Issue #36 proof harness, run it against the exact baseline subject, and append Checkpoint 0 only after the actual measurements and artifacts exist.

The proof harness is intentionally separate from the measured subject checkout so the same frozen harness can run against both baseline and final revisions with only the subject SHA changing.
